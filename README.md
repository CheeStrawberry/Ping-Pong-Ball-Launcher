# Ping-Pong-Ball-Launcher üèìü§ñ

Ever wanted to play ping pong but don‚Äôt have a partner? No worries, I‚Äôve got just the thing for you! Introducing the **Ping Pong Ball Launcher**: a LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robot that steps in as your perfect solo opponent. This project turns your EV3 kit into a smart, ball-launching machine, ready to sharpen your reflexes and bring the fun.

To get started, you'll need to install the RobotC IDE, connect your LEGO robot, and load the code into it. Once everything is set up, you‚Äôre ready to code, create, and enjoy some high-tech ping pong action!

## Features ‚ú®

- **Targeting with Sensors**:
  - **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Detects objects and triggers the ball launch when in range. 
  - **Gyro Sensor**: Ensures precise rotation, aligning every shot perfectly. 

- **Countdown Music**: Adds a suspenseful tone sequence before each launch. 

- **Ball Launching Mechanism**: Adjustable motor power for precise and powerful shots. 

- **Smart Rotation**: Rotates the robot to the perfect angle for each launch. 

- **Difficulty Modes**:
  - **Easy Mode**: Straightforward shooting, no rotation. 
  - **Medium Mode**: Adds rotational challenges for more fun. 
  - **Hard Mode**: For experts, with complex movements and no countdown assist.
